When I first opened your project and saw the windows designer I was awestruck. This is such a simple and elegant design and I love it. I like the idea of using the radio buttons to make a selection and then having one search button to press. This is a very good solution that is simple and easy to read and understand at a glance.

For some reason I was unable to launch your code due to some sort of error with it connecting to the database. I think that we are using different versions of SQL server and I had several issues recently forcing uninstall/reinstall of SQL to get SSMS working correctly on this machine, which may have created the issue. So, sadly, I was not able to test the code to make sure it works correctly or to its fullest. It did appear to me that the database was copied to the correct location in the bin/debug folder within your project so that shouldn’t have been the hang up.

I like that the catches you have also clear out the bad input in addition to displaying a message about how to correct that. That is a solid thing to do to help users understand where errors are made and how to correct them. I personally prefer the “long hand” LINQ statements. I spoke to a couple of friends who work in DevOps and programming and they pointed out that these types of expressions require fewer comments to understand and are actually preferred at their companies. I also love this “clearButton” you have. I will need to look into how this works to see if I can use something similar going forward, as opposed to clearing out each field, unchecking every box, and/or reorganizing data one by one back to their defaults. From what I can gather from the code it looks like selecting a radio button causes other fields to hide, which would definitely help to further reduce confusion on a window that has many blank boxes but only ever requires one to two of them to be filled. Nice work!
